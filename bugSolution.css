One way to avoid this issue and improve CSS maintainability is to restructure the CSS to eliminate the need for `!important`.  For example, you could use more specific selectors or adjust the CSS hierarchy.  The solution below provides an example:

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 24px;
}

.child .grandchild {
  font-size: 18px; 
}
```

This version does not use `!important`, making it more predictable.  The `font-size` will now correctly cascade through the hierarchy, with the `.grandchild`'s declaration overriding its parent's.  Other solutions might involve using a different methodology to override the styles, and avoiding relying on !important.
