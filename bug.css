The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 24px !important;
}

.child .grandchild {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

In this example, the `.grandchild` element inherits the `font-size` from its parent, `.child`, but also overrides it with its own declaration. However, the `!important` declaration on the `.child` element has higher specificity, and hence should override the declaration on `.grandchild`.  The unexpected behavior may occur in browsers that handle specificity and the `!important` flag differently, causing the `font-size` to be 18px, or unexpectedly 24px.
