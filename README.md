# CSS Specificity Bug: !important and Inheritance Conflict

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity and inheritance when using the `!important` flag. The bug involves unexpected behavior in how browsers handle specificity in the presence of inheritance and the `!important` declaration.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the interaction between inheritance and the `!important` flag in CSS.  The expected behavior might not always align with the actual rendered output, especially in certain browser implementations. This bug is particularly relevant when dealing with complex CSS structures.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` to see the CSS code that demonstrates the unexpected behavior.
3. Open `bugSolution.css` for a potential solution.  Note that the best solution might involve restructuring your CSS for better maintainability.

## Solution

A possible solution is provided in `bugSolution.css`. It focuses on improving CSS structure to avoid the specificity conflict.  The `!important` flag should generally be used sparingly, as it can make CSS difficult to maintain and debug.
